# FRC_Robot2.0
Welcome to the SOTAbots GitHub repository! This repo is divided into branches based on the years and the project within the branches create a form of leveled organization. The main coding happens in bugfix, works into dev, then subMaster. When a "merge" into subMaster happens, a release tag will be made.
